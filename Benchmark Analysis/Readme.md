# Benchmark analysis for RCs

Results for the global simultaneous fit to the parameters involving the rotation curves of all 10 galaxies in the
LTs sample and using the same axionic mass ($m_{a}=1.9\times10^{-23}$ eV). The directories contain the following diagnostics and results:

1. Fits on RCs

2. Corner plots with parameters posteriors distributions

3. Correlation times behavior for each MCMC

4. Relatons and diagnostics

5. Density profiles

Note: In the cases where it applies, $c_{\text{vir}}$ is used to denote the concentration parameter, while in our paper we use the shorthand $c.$  Density profiles correspond to the scatter in density mapped from the 68 and 95 \% CL values in rotation curves, while central values are taken to be the midpoint of the 68  \%  CL (rotation curve) scatter. The best (maximum posterior) fit of NFW is included for reference purposes.
