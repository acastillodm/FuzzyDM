# Variable mass analysis for RCs

Results for the global simultaneous fit to the parameters involving the rotation curves of all 13 galaxies in the
LTs sample and using the axionic mass as free parameter. The directories contain the following diagnostics and results:

1. Fits on RCs

2. Corner plots with parameters posteriors distributions

3. Correlation times behavior for each MCMC

4. Relations and diagnostics

5. Density profiles
