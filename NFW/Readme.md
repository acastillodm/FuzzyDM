#  Analysis for RCs in the NFW model

Results for the fit in the NFW mass model. The directories contain the following diagnostics and results:

1. Fits on RCs

2. Corner plots with parameters posteriors distributions

3. Correlation times behavior for each MCMC

4. Relations and diagnostics

Note: In the plots where it applies, the concentration parameter $c_{\text{vir}}$ is used to denote the concentration parameter, while in our paper we use the shorthand $c.$
