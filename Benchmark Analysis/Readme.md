# Benchmark analysis for RCs

Results for the global simultaneous fit to the parameters involving the rotation curves of all 10 galaxies in the
LTs sample and using the same axionic mass ($m_{a}=1.9\times10^{-23}$ eV). The directories contain the following diagnostics and results:

1. Fits on RCs

2. Corner plots with parameters posteriors distributions

3. Correlation times behavior for each MCMC

4. Relatons and diagnostics

5. Density profiles

Note: In the cases where it applies, $c_{\text{vir}}$ is used to denote the concentration parameter, while in our paper we use the shorthand $c.$
