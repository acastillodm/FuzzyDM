# Variable mass analysis for RCs

Results for the global simultaneous fit to the parameters involving the rotation curves of all 13 galaxies in the
LTs sample and using the axionic mass as free parameter. The directories contain the following diagnostics and results:

1. Fits on RCs

2. Corner plots with parameters posteriors distributions

3. Correlation times behavior for each MCMC

4. Relations and diagnostics

5. Density profiles

Note: In the cases where it applies, $c_{\text{vir}}$ is used to denote the concentration parameter, while in our paper we use the shorthand $c.$ Also, in the corner plots of the scaling correlations section of the variable mass analysis, $<\sigma^2>$ is the observational mean square error used to express the units of the error parameter $v.$ Density profiles correspond to the scatter in density mapped from the 68 and 95 $\%$ CL values in rotation curves, while central values are taken to be the midpoint of the 68  $\%$  (rotation curve) scatter. The best (maximum posterior) fit of NFW is included for reference.
